# WELCOME
The Platform is the common infrastructure, technical and non-technical components, and processes that support static and interactive content consumed by Veterans via VA.gov. Major pieces of the Platform include a set of APIs that manage communication between a Veteran user and internal VA resources, an identity and authentication system, the VA.gov Design System, reusable frontend components, a Drupal-based content management system, and an extensive set of documentation and guides.
## Before you begin
In order to get through the platform orientation without issue, there are 2 prerequisites:
1. You have access to your VA.gov email address
2. You have a PIV card or are able to go through the PIV exception process
If you are unsure if you meet these 2 prerequisites, please talk to your product manager or COR to ensure that you are properly setup.
