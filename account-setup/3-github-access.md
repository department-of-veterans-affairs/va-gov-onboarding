# GitHub

With the VA.gov platform, all code will be managed via GitHub repositories. In order to access all the GitHub repositories you will need to build VA products, you will need to be part of the appropriate VA GitHub organization.

# Requesting access to the VA GitHub Organization

Before you can request access to the VA GitHub organization, there are a few prerequisuites that you will need to meet:

- Have access to your VA.gov email address
- Have access to your PIV card

If you do not have your PIV card yet, you may instead go through the PIV Exception process to gain access into the VA GitHub organization. The process to do that will be explained later.

### Getting access to the VA GitHub Organization with a PIV Card

1. Ask your Program Manager to submit an Add User to the VA Organization ticket.

- The ticket submitter will need to have VA GitHub Org access already.
- Ask your Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) to post their approval on this ticket to expedite the approval process.
- This process is managed by the VA GitHub admins, not the Platform, and may take a few days to process.

2. Once your ticket is processed, check your email for an invitation to the VA GitHub Organization, and join!

- Note: Make sure you’re signed into the correct GitHub account before you accept the invitation.

3. Once you've been added, add information to your GitHub profile:

- Organization: Your company name
- Working on: The project your team is working on, e.g., "526 ancillary forms"
- Visit the VA GitHub Handbook for more information and additional resources.

### Getting access to the VA Github Organization without a PIV Card

New hires that do not have a PIV card or GFE yet will need to request a PIV exemption from IT to access their virtual desktop and VA email through Citrix from their personal machine. If you are using a Mac, the OS must be >10.14.x.

1. Call 1-855-673-4357 (this is the main number for VA IT) hit ‘0’ a few times to be connected to a representative
2. Tell the rep that you are a new hire that does not have access to your government furnished equipment (GFE) or PIV card yet and you would like to “create a username and password exemption for Citrix Access Gateway (CAG)
3. Tell the rep you also heard there needs to be updates in two places

- CAG two-factor authentication exemption
- RESCUE PIV exemption

4. The rep will walk you through some steps and provide a login and temporary password.
5. Wait 20 minutes. It takes almost exactly 20 minutes for the changes to propagate.
6. Go to https://citrixaccess.va.gov/ use your username (it should be something like DVA\VACOMILLER) and password, and you should be able to access a virtual desktop.
