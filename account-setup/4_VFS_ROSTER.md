# VFS ROSTER
The VA manages certain permissions through a master list of employees called the "VFS Roster". In order to be added into the "VFS Roster", you must submit this [GitHub issue](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?assignees=&labels=analytics-insights%2C+analytics-request%2C+governance-team%2C+platform-orientation&template=orientation-epic.md&title=Platform+Orientation+Template+%5BYour+name+here%5D) with your following information:
 - Name:
 - Preferred pronouns (e.g. she/her):
 - Role:

 - GitHub handle*:

For this onboarding process, you will **NOT** need to complete the rest of the onboarding checklist within the roster. Please submit the information and a member of the VA.gov platform will place you into the "VFS Roster" within a week.
