#  What is a VA.gov React Widget?

A VA.gov React Widget ("Widget") is a small React component that is mounted into a `<div>` on a static content page. A static content page is an HTML page whose content is provided by a Content Management System (CMS). While a VA.gov "Application" fills an entire page between the header and footer of VA.gov, a "Widget" only fills in a subsection of the page, allowing developers to include dynamic content into the page without changing the entire application itself.
