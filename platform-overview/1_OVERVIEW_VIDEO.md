# Platform Orientation

Welcome to Platform Orientation! Platform Orientation was designed to onboard and orient new VFS teams and VFS team members to Platform products, processes, services, standards, and expectations.

Orientation will point your teams and team members in the right direction to ensure you have the knowledge and tools necessary and to ensure you're familiar with the VA.gov landscape to successfully build products for VA.gov.

## Overview Video
